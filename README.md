# [Newspaper Agency Project](https://github.com/baranovr/newspaper-agency-project)

This project was created to implement a newspaper management system. The project was made using Django, which combines a backend (Python) and a frontend (HTML, JS blocks).
<br>

The project presents three models:
- `Topic`
- `Newspaper`
- `Redactor`

Topic does not depend on other models, the `Newspaper` model has a dependence on `Topic` 
(and the name Topic divides newspapers into topics by **Foreign Key**) and the `Newspaper` has a **ManyToMany** relation with the `Redactor` 
(because one newspaper can have several redactors (publishers)).
<br>

Here you can you see the database structure:
